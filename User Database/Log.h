    I wrote a draft of some database I can think of. And I divide each part by /*--------* / to signal that this is a new section. Mainly by "phase 1" "phase 2", and then sub-category. Feel free to adjust, delete and add anything :)
    1) Sigle "*P --> " means my note for our project development.
    2) "..." inside a class means I don't have an idea of implementations
    3) I will draw a logical graph to show the class hierarchy
